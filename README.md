# Google Clone App

Have you ever tried cloning a web app of some giant and popular corporations? Well, I have, last year (2021). It was a replica of the Google search engine (design + functionality), being one of my first serious projects that I've worked on. Throughout the way, I have learned how to use React functional components more efficiently and combine it with Google API.

Tech used:
- React
- Redux
- Vanila CSS
- Material UI
- Google API

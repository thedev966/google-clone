                "Exogenous silver in brain and spinal cord sections from rats treated with Protargol, silver lactate or silver nitrate was visualized by physical development. The silver penetrated the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in neurones and glia. The distribution of silver in the CNS was heterogeneous. Even with low doses and short survival periods, silver was found to accumulate in large motoneurones in the brain stem and spinal cord and neurones in the cerebellar nuclei. Silver was only found in di- and telencephalic structures after extensive exposure. Silver distribution following oral silver lactate and silver nitrate treatment differed in that silver nitrate resulted in a relatively high content of silver in glia whereas deposition occurred preferentially in neurones following silver lactate treatment. Electron-microscopical studies showed that silver was located intracellularly in the lysosomes and extracellularly in basement membranes and elastic fibres of the vessels.",

                "Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are known to penetrate into the brain and cause neuronal death. However, there is a paucity in studies examining the effect of AgNP on the resident immune cells of the brain, microglia. Given microglia are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), it is important to examine how AgNPs affect microglial inflammation to fully assess AgNP neurotoxicity. In addition, understanding AgNP processing by microglia will allow better prediction of their long term bioreactivity. In the present study, the in vitro uptake and intracellular transformation of citrate-capped AgNPs by microglia, as well as their effects on microglial inflammation and related neurotoxicity were examined. Analytical microscopy demonstrated internalization and dissolution of AgNPs within microglia and formation of non-reactive silver sulphide (Ag2S) on the surface of AgNPs. Furthermore, AgNP-treatment up-regulated microglial expression of the hydrogen sulphide (H2S)-synthesizing enzym",
